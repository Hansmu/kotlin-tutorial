Kotlin can run anywhere the JVM can run

Kotlin is interoperable with Java. Can just drop Kotlin code into Java classes.

Kotlin compiler takes .kt extension files as input and generates bytecode as .class files. When distributing Kotlin applications, have to distribute the Kotlin runtime library.

Can use functional programming (can use functions as values - can return them from functions, use them as parameters)
